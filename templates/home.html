  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p> MOSCA1 was developed in Python 3 and was tested in an Ubuntu server
16.04. MOSCA is fully automated to do a complete analysis of raw files gener-
ated by NGS (from MG and MT experiments), using the default parameters and

tools. Nevertheless, the user can choose at the beginning between different as-
semblers and can also select the database used for the annotation step. MOSCA

performs the complete bioinformatics analysis of MG and MT experiments. It
includes the following major steps that run sequentially: preprocessing, assembly,
annotation and differential gene expression between multiple samples.</p>
  <p>MOSCA has been designed to work in a Unix system, and requires a minimum of
10Gb of RAM, since the assemblers integrated in the workflow, MetaSPAdes
and Megahit, spend approximately 30Gb and 10Gb of RAM, respectively. All
integrated software has to be previously installed, and their directories specified.</p>
